1. CPU: Barnes-hut is faster than naive

1k bodies on naive approach cpu ~ 12.000 ms
1k bodies on barnes-hut approach cpu ~ 9.000 ms

10k bodies on naive approach cpu ~ 1.200.000 ms (100x slower)
10k bodies on barnes-hut approach cpu ~ 240.000 ms (25x slower)

2. Cpu barnes-hut and gpu (initialization only) barnes-hut are similar

1k bodies both ~ 9.000 ms96
10k bodies both ~ 240.000 ms (25x slower)
